# Cygwin-installer-updater-script
A little script for updating Cygwin installer automatically

1. It require you have Cygwin installed,
2. You have to edit the script and set the path of you cygwin installation folder and set delay between each check (it's not usefull to check for update every hour, it's 72 hours by default).
3. It's better to call this script with the Windows Task Sheduler or by putting it in the startup programs folder.
